# Tiramisu

"Representation learning is a set of methods that allows a machine to be fed with raw data and to automatically discover the representations needed for detection or classification. Deep-learning methods are representation-learning methods..."
[Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio & Geoffrey Hinton, "Deep Learning", Nature, 521, p.436â€“444, 28 May 2015]

The goal of this project is to build an inference system based on deep learning learnt representations. Representations are extracted from CNN (see the fork of caffe project in https://github.com/dariogarcia/caffe). These representation are then loaded by tiramisu, which will explore its structural properties, and exploit them for inference through graph mining methods.
